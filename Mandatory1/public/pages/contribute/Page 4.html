                <h3 id="title">CSR vs. SSR</h3>
                <p id="content">Advantages of SSR: <br><br> Better SEO and page ranking, since the HTML is fully formed on the server-side and web crawlers are more easily able to index the HTML pages.
                    Faster load time for the initial page render that a CSR App, since the HTML received from the server can be quickly parsed by the browser and displayed immediately, and does not require a separate JS bundle to be downloaded and executed to display the webpage.
                    Once the web page is visible in the browser it is fully interactive
                    Since the HTML for the webpage is generated on the server-side, the webpage will display even if the browser Javascript is disabled.
                    Disadvantages of SSR: <br><br>
                    Poor responsiveness for low or no Internet connectivity, since every page navigation makes a round trip to the server to receive the HTML.
                    For Dynamic SSR, increased server load as the web traffic increases, since the server needs to dynamically generate HTML for every request.
                    Advantages of CSR: <br><br>
                    Extremely fast and responsive after initial load, since after the initial load all the HTML for the website is generated on the client-side (by Javascript), without any round trips to the server to get the HTML. Also any real time data fetches can be handled client-side by client-side Javascript code making external API calls.
                    Disadvantages of CSR: <br><br>
                    Long initial load time, the browser must wait for the entire Javascript bundle to be downloaded and executed on the client-side, before the initial render. During this time the user is staring at a blank web page.
                    Code-splitting, or lazy-loading strategies can be used to reduce the amount of assets that the browser needs to download for the initial page render, and this can greatly improve TTI (time-to-interactive) for apps with large bundles.
